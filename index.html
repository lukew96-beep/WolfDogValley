<center><h2>By Luke Williamson</h2></center>
<p>In the mostly deserted area of Doswell, Virgina, Kings Dominion, 
    now a massive themepark, started. It did not however, start as the normal conventional park we know
     it as today. There was a time when the land filled with rollercoasters and screams was a wild safari 
     adventure park and they took extreme measures
     to insure interesting species. They were willing to go as far as it took.</p>

<h2>You CREATED WHAT?!</h2>
<p>The doctors in the bio-lab were there three hours earlier on January 15, 1975.
While the rest of the safari workers were at home these eager scientist were
playing god in a way that would have terrible consequences. A wolf sat on the 
operation table completely unaware of what was about to be done to it. Three other
wolves laid on obersevation tables to each side. Beside the observation tables
was the instructions for a wolf, dog hibrid. A cross between wolves and 
    routerilers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract blood from canine specimine</li>
<li> Spin blood in centrifuge for aproximately thirty seconds.</li>
<li>Inject blood into wolf species of exact blood type after adding 
three CCs of Adrenaline</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the scientists injected the first specimine and it imediately
    began to convulse uncontrollably. "We need 30 CCs of valium stat!", 
    shouted the frantic vet. In the rocking the button control for the 
    other spicimins got hit as well. "Great, hell! WHAT have we done?!"
</p>
<p>The rouge animals ran through the park destroying entire packs of 
    other animals as they went. Through multiple types of artificial
    man-made terain they bolted until they reached the edge of the 
    property where stood a chainlinked fence. With one single bound
    the creatures escaped, never to be recovered by the scientists.
    The safari park was shut down and replaced with the area of the park
    that now houses the ruins of volcano. Legend says that these animals
    still roam the area surrounding the park to this day.
